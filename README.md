Welsh has some sounds and pronunciation patterns that are not common in English and some other languages, and can therefore cause difficulties for those learning the language.

In this project, we provide insights into the pronunciation of Welsh language by employing state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at Cardiff Universityâ€™s world-leading Brain Imaging Centre (CUBRIC).

For this project, 20 videos of Welsh speakers will be examined. The project focuses on the analysis of optical flow methods (LiteFlowNet, RAFT, PWC-Net) and super-resolution techniques (ESRGAN,  MSRResNet, RCAN) in the context of analysing MRI videos of Welsh speakers
